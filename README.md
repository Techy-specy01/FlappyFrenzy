🎮 Overview
FLAPPYFRENZY is a side-scrolling arcade game where player controls a bird navigating through pairs of green pipes. The objective is to fly as far as possible without
colliding with pipes or the ground, earning points for each pipe successfully passed.
The game features classic Flappy Bird mechanics with smooth animations, real-time scoring, and instant restart functionality, all implemented using Python's PYGAME library.

✨Features

Smooth Gameplay: 60 FPS gameplay with fluid bird animations
Dynamic Obstacles: Randomly generated pipe heights for varied difficulty
Real-time Scoring: Live score tracking with visual feedback
Instant Restart: Quick game restart functionality
Collision Detection: Pixel-perfect collision system
Retro Graphics: Classic 2D sprite-based visuals

🎯 Game Rules
Objective
Navigate the bird through as many pipe pairs as possible to achieve the highest score.
Scoring System
+1 Point: Awarded for each pipe pair successfully passed
Game Over: Occurs when the bird collides with pipes, ground, or ceiling
High Score: Track your best performance across sessions
